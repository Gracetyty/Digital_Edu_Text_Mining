 Digital_Edu_Text_Mining
 
The repository has two parts of text mining tasks for analyzing educational publications in Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence.

The VR Notebook has run through papers published from 1944 to 2021 in order to gain an insight into the development of researchers in relevant areas. For the text data, they are mainly from rabbit search: the search criteria is following: type in key words: immersive education, immersive technology, VR, AR, so there were thousands of papers gained from the collection through Rabbit search engine. 

In order to get to know an overall progress of AI-related researches, I searched key words, such as “Artificial Intelligence”, “Education” and obtained total 50 publications from 1953 to 2021. Through using text mining on the python, I found that among the topics of AI in Education, researches have shown interests in personalised adaptive learning, computer-assisted education, automatic question generation, STEM, and gamification.
